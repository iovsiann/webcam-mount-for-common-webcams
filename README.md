# handy-webcam-holder
A handy webcam holder for Voron 2.4, 3D printers using 2020 extrusions. It gloriously fits common webcams that have a horizontal tube-like hole in the back - and mounts to the aforementioned 2020 extrusions.

1. Print the parts. Use ABS, PETG or ASA that can withstand temperatures higher than PLA* in your print chamber.
2. Take an M3 screw long enough to span between the two arms; drive it through the left arm into the plastic hole of the right arm
3. Affix the two extrusion mounts to the 2020 extrusion using M3 screws and extrusion slot nuts or T-nuts or hammer nuts or roll-in-spring nuts
4. Tighten the long M3 screw gently. The webcam should stay firmly in place (not drop down), but be moveable by hand with little effort. Don't overtighten.

* Avoid PLA for load-bearing or tensioned prints because PLA can (slowly) deform over time at room temperatures.
Place your PLA part behind a window letting in the bright California sunlight and check what happens after 24 hours if you don't believe me!
2. Mount the camera using a piece of 1.75 filament
