1. Print the parts
2. Mount the camera using a piece of 1.75 filament
3. Insert an M3 nut
4. Insert an M3 screw long enough to grab onto the nut
5. Affix the two extrusion mounts to the 2020 extrusion using M3 screws and extrusion slot nuts or T-nuts or hammer nuts or roll-in-spring nuts
6. Tighten the long M3 screw gently. The webcam should stay firmly in place (not drop down), but be moveable by hand with little effort. Don't overtighten.
